# UCRD Management System

A comprehensive PHP-SQLite web application for managing university research center data, including researchers, supervisors, projects, and publications.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Start the UCRD Management System**
   ```
   ./ucrdm
   ```
   This single command starts the PHP server automatically and shows the status of your database.

   Alternatively, you can use:
   ```
   php -S localhost:9000
   ```

2. **Access the application**
   - Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:9000
   - Log in with default credentials:
     - Username: admin
     - Password: admin123

3. **Import Sample Data (Optional)**
   - After logging in, go to Tools â†’ Database Backup in the navigation menu
   - Or navigate directly to: http://localhost:9000/import_sample_data.php
   - Check the confirmation box and click "Import Sample Data"
   - This will populate your database with sample supervisors, researchers, projects and publications

4. **Database Information**
   - This version uses SQLite instead of MySQL
   - The database file is stored at `ucrd_management.sqlite` in the root directory
   - No separate database server needed

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4 or higher with SQLite support
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UCRD-Management-System.git
   ```
   Or download and extract the ZIP file

2. **Run the Application**
   ```
   cd UCRD-Management-System
   ./ucrdm
   ```

3. **Initialize with Sample Data (Optional)**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:9000/import_sample_data.php 
   - Check the confirmation box and click "Import Sample Data"

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**: If you see errors related to database connection, ensure SQLite is enabled in your PHP installation.
- **Session Warnings**: If you see warnings about sessions already being active, these are harmless notifications that don't affect functionality.
- **Permission Errors**: Make sure the directory has write permissions for the SQLite database file.
- **Port Already in Use**: If port 9000 is already in use, edit the `ucrdm` script and change the port number.
